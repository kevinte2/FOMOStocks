# LaptopAlarm

LaptopAlarm sends you an SMS text if your laptop is stolen! After locking your PC, a verification text is sent to your phone confirming that it has been secured.

Requirements:
- LaptopAlarm must be manually run/installed on startup
- Your laptop must be connected to AC power

Upon change in state (ex. disconnection from AC power), your laptop sends you a text to alert you that it has been confiscated.
